# Discrete_curve_group_code

This repository contains the code used for curve group analyses of genes as performed in Lund et al. 2016 (hyperlink here)
The code is written by Marit Holden.


# Repository

This method requires R and some dependencies mentioned in the scripts.

The five scripts in this project constitute the analyses performed 
using the breast cancer case-control data set described in the publication.
The scripts are somewhat adopted from the original analysis to analyse prospective case-control data sets in general.

# Usage

The main script is analyseData.r which calls the other scripts.

Adjustments of reading in the data must be performed for each data set.

There are also choices to consider with regards to choosing the number of people/
duration in time that is included in each curve group 
(in analyseData.r)

# Citation

When used, the method should be cited with reference to
Lund et al.
Also, the code is to be cited in the acknowledgement section of the paper as 
"The code used for analysis is provided in a repository at https://github. com/xxx"

or using the doi: in the method section of the paper
